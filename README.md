# Queueing theory simulations

grade_of_service.m : function that calculates grade of service
queue.m : function that takes arrival times, service times and number of servers as an input and computes departure times
simulate.m : function that simulates queueing process for different numbers of servers

Simulation_service_times.m : script, that plots average execution times for different numbers of servers and different mean service times
Simulation_team_sizes.m : script, that plots average execution times for different numbers of servers and different team sizes
